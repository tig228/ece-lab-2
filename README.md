We defined some variables and we made use of the P4DIR, P4REN, P4OUT, P2DIR, P2REN, and P2OUT registers
We also assigned imputs and outputs pins. The input pin is the 4.1 pin while the output pin is the 1.0 pin. We assigned code to the two buttons that if one is pressed(S1) the red LED should turn on and if the second button is pressed(S2) the green light should turn on.
